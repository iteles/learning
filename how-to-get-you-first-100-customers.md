# How to get your first 100 customers

The information in these notes is relatively sparse compared to the slides.
I'll update a link to these soon.

### Useful Tools
`import.io` is good for any companies that have directories - includes companies that have won awards for example

### CRM
+ Recommend getbase.com
+ If someone is using your competitor, you can always say 'that's great, at the moment they're better than us' then you can call them back in 2 months and say 'ok, now we're better than them'

**Loss reasons**
+ Using a competitor
  + You need to know _exactly_ why you're better than them
  + e.g. If the customer service of your customer is terrible, get them to ring the customer service line on their mobile phone and you will pitch your idea in the time it takes them to pick up ;)
+ Didn't see the value
  + Need to improve your sales pitch
+ Trust
  + Need case studies
  
### Turning cold email/cal into warm lead
+ If you don't have a case study, put a link to the website and say 'I recently wrote a blog on why we started the company' 0r I guess why we believe in such and such a thing which perfectly matches what your company does
+ Think about best email hit rate; e.g. a good time to email startups is 19h30 - not too late, but they're no longer firefighting

### Email Tools
+ `hook.io` get detailed feedback on your cold emails for free!
+ `replyapp.io` follows up on emails automatically and the second someone emails you, it breaks the chain

### Gate Keepers - how to avoid them
+ Try calling 08h30 - 09h00 or 17h00 - 17h30, the gatekeepers are often not in office yet but owners often are
  + 4 Hour Work Week talks a lot about good times to call
+ Be concise and **be comfortable with silence**
  + "Hi, it's Patrick from x company, can I please speak to [owner's name]?" and that's it, now be quiet
+ If the gatekeeper is great, **take down their name** and be nice - you can then say 'thanks David, I'll give you a call again next week' and the next time you can say 'Hi David, it's Paul, could you please put me through to x person' - _create a rapport_

### Closing
Most important thing is to **get feedback**. This goes hand in hand with being comfortable with silence above. Ask the question and wait for the answer.

Use zapier to look for people with more than x followers that has mentioned a keyword that is relevant to you in the last 6 months, you send them a direct message with a blog post you've written recently that you think they might be interested in. They you get them on your website where you have more control of them and can get them on your mailing list via a sign up or free content

`manageflitter` good for finding keywords people are talking about and lets you donwload competitor's followers
