# International Research @ Google

Notes taken at [Ladies That UX London](http://www.ladiesthatux.com/ltux_cities/london/), Tuesday 13th October 2015.

Presenters work mostly on search and maps.

## Shift Focus
Shifting of the focus towards emerging markets like China, Nigeria and India which make up the top internet user countries in the world.

Key things in these emerging markets:
+ Mobile first - they've never used a computer
+ Smartphones have smaller screens and memories, provided by local vendors for under $1000
+ Second hand devices are very popular
+ Majority of users are on pre-paid, low data plans with often less than 3G connections
  + Extensive user research in these markets was the motivation for creating YouTube Offline
  
Examples of culture and context in Brazil:
+ **Safety:** participants always say are cautious about using phones in public
+ **Payment forms:** participants often preferred to buy something online and pay in cash when the product arrives

Examples of culture and context in India:
+ Maps: "turn left at _x_ landmark" as opposed to "turn left at street _x_" because that's how people talk to each other

## Build Empathy

+ 60% of international research is in the pre-planning
  + **Desk research:** research people, culture and economy
    + Look at what people are using at the moment already to solve those problems
  
+ You cannot understand a whole country in one trip - set those expectations in your company
+ There are no _'observers'_ on a research trip. Make sure everyone has a job taking photos or notes, or specifically paying attention to body language (even if they're not a researcher, but a product owner for example)
+ **Immerse yourself** in the local experience and test the use cases on the go
  + When you're being pushed around in Rio de Janeiro public transport or sidewalks, can you use maps?
  + Try buying a SIM card (in Brazil it's a 3 day event)
  + Find a meal for under $5
  + Try homesharing
  + Go to local places - what kind of social experiences inform your product use?
  + Example: By the time researchers were able to give a rickshaw driver in India directions using maps, he had already asked the guy parked in traffic next to him and was already following _his_ directions

**Getting buy-in**
+ Find a champion within your organisation so you're not the only one peddling the benefits of international research
  + Bring stakeholders (often project managers and the product team you're researching for and possibly engineers/developers) along for the research (Google does it every time)
+ Have goals before you go out there, have hypotheses you can test against
+  Seeing is believing, there is _no_ replacement for first hand experience
+ Do group debriefs for _everyone_ who was in attendance afterwards as everyone has slightly different perspective
  + In-built buy-in for the findings rather than coming back and presenting to the product team and trying to convince them of findings they didn't see
  + Makes sure everyone hears _all_ the stories

## Change Culture (How to do it)
+ Communicate with lots of different mediums like videos or posters - anything that gets the message across
+ Google's six Cs are the things engineers, designers, etc need to think about when creating products for these markets (checklist)
+ Use the actual devices of the markets to test and test side by side with modern devices
  + Use throttling to slow down internet connections
+ Lots of remote user testing
  + Lots of surveys
  + usabilitytesting.com and gotomeeting


## Tips from the Q&A
+ Work with local teams (local moderators) so participants in your study are more at ease
  + Hire the best simultaneous translators (they translate word-for-word) and it's _very expensive_ - you shouldn't even notice they're there
+ Don't specifically tell them what company you're with (just a tech company) or what you're looking to test so that they don't just tell you what you want to hear 
  + Ask how they would do things naturally
  + Talk about competitors too - if they say they love your thing but they're way more effusive about a competitor, it helps you understand their true feelings (and if they're just trying to please you)
+ Provide stakeholders (the product team) who are accompanying you with lots of training on how to behave in accordance to the local culture
  + Get stakeholders to watch movies about the place you're going to
+ If there's a specific question you need an answer to, try asking it three times (in different words) throughout the conversation as people relax and rethink as the relationship progresses
+ Finding participants - also ask the people you know from that country to get you introductions of friends of friends (not their immediate family)

**Hardest things about UX research**
+ Being able to ensure that once you come back the results are not forgotten - you have to learn how to _sell_ your findings otherwise people will forget them
+ Product teams just want one or two insights, not 10 insights. You have to tie everything together into one memorable story or people won't want all that information 
+ "Communication is the number 1 skill of the researcher"
